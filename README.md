In Go, `&variable` and `*pointer` are related to how you work with pointers and values:

1. **`&variable`**:
   - This syntax is used to get the memory address of a variable in Go.
   - It returns a pointer to the variable's memory address.
   - This is also known as the "address of" operator.

   Example:
   ```go
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       x := 10
       fmt.Println("Value of x:", x)     // Output: Value of x: 10
       fmt.Println("Address of x:", &x)  // Output: Address of x: 0xc0000140a8 (example address)
   }
   ```

   In this example, `&x` gives the memory address where the variable `x` is stored.

2. **`*pointer`**:
   - This syntax is used to dereference a pointer in Go.
   - It retrieves the value that the pointer points to.

   Example:
   ```go
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       x := 10
       ptr := &x         // ptr is a pointer to x
       fmt.Println(*ptr) // Output: 10 (value at the memory address stored in ptr)
   }
   ```

   Here, `*ptr` retrieves the value stored at the memory address stored in `ptr`.

### Key Differences:
- `&variable` gives you the memory address of a variable.
- `*pointer` gives you the value stored at the memory address pointed to by `pointer`.

### When to Use:
- **`&variable`**: Use when you need to pass a variable's address to a function or store it for later use, especially when you want to modify the original variable within a function.
  
- **`*pointer`**: Use when you have a pointer and want to access or modify the value it points to.

In Go, understanding pointers and their usage (`&variable` and `*pointer`) is crucial for managing memory efficiently and for implementing certain advanced patterns such as data structures or when working with functions that need to modify variables indirectly.
